"""
This is the documentation for the **gpf** (*Geocom Python Framework*) package for **Python 2.7**.
For the Python 3 version (suitable for ArcGIS Pro), please refer to the **gpf3** package.

The *gpf* package contains several subpackages with tools and helpers for all kinds of
ArcGIS-related geoprocessing and data management tasks.
It is released under the MIT license as an open-source product,
allowing the community to freely use it, improve it and possibly add new features.

Several tools in this package require Esri's ``arcpy`` Python library, which does not make this a *free* package.
However, users who have already installed and authorized ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap, ArcCatalog etc.) should be able to work
with this package without any problems.
