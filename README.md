# Geocom Python Framework (GPF)

The *Geocom Python Framework* or `gpf` provides a set of Python modules that contain tools, helpers, loggers etc. for a more pleasant Python scripting experience in ArcGIS and/or [GEONIS](https://geonis.com/en/solutions/framework/geonis).  
GIS users who need to write geoprocessing scripts with `arcpy` might benefit from importing the `gpf` module into their script as well.

The `gpf` module in this repository has been developed for Python 2.7.14+ (ArcGIS Desktop/Server, 32-bit).
However, it is [also available for Python 3.6+](gpf3) (ArcGIS Pro, Server).  

GIS users who need to write GEONIS menu or form scripts should also check out the [`gntools` module](gntools).

## Requirements

- ArcGIS Desktop and/or ArcGIS Server 10.6 or higher
